# Garbage-Classification-ResNet50

This project focuses on building a ML model that classifies household waste into 12 categories, ranking from paper and plastic to batteries. Using a pretrained ResNet-50 model with transfer learning, the model achieved 94.88% of test accuracy with 1.9. This model has the potential to increase the accuracy of garbage classification, helping to improve recycling rates and reduce environmental waste.
